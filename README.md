# To Build
The root of this repository is actually the build output directory.
This is because Github Pages requires ```index.html``` to be in the root of the repo.
Because of this, you must run all ```gulp``` (```bower```, ```npm```, etc) commands from within the ```src``` directory.
```bash
cd src
gulp build
```

# To Run
```bash
cd src
gulp serve
```
